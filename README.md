# CNN for CIFAR-10 Classification

This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow's Keras API for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Overview

The project implements a CNN architecture using TensorFlow's Keras API to perform image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is designed to recognize and classify 10 different object classes present in the dataset. Python programming language, TensorFlow, and Keras were utilized for the implementation.

## Requirements

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/CNN-for-CIFAR-10-Classification.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script in your preferred environment.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook/script to load the CIFAR-10 dataset, preprocess the data, define the CNN architecture, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Files

- `cnn_cifar10_classification.ipynb` (or `.py`): Jupyter Notebook (or Python script) containing the code for the CNN implementation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the CIFAR-10 dataset used for training and testing.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset comprises 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.
